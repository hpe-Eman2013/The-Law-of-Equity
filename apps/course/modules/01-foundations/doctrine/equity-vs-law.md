Purpose (Boundary between law & equity)
-> Explains:
    -> Why equity exists
    -> When law fails
    -> When equity refuses relief even if law allows it

This prevents student confusion between:
-> Legal rights ❌
-> Equitable relief ✅

Modern courts rely on this distinction heavily.

Equity vs. Law: Jurisdictional Boundaries and Functional Differences
I. Why the Distinction Still Matters
Although most modern courts have merged law and equity procedurally, they have not merged them substantively.
This means:
•	The same court may hear both legal and equitable claims
•	But it must still determine which body of principles governs
•	And which remedies are available
Failure to distinguish between law and equity leads to:
•	improper pleadings
•	denial of equitable relief
•	misapplication of defenses
•	fatal jurisdictional errors

II. Law Defined (In Functional Terms)
Law is a system of fixed rules applied to determine:
•	legal rights
•	legal duties
•	legal remedies
At common law:
•	rights were enforced through forms of action
•	remedies were limited, primarily to money damages
•	relief followed rules, not discretion
Law is concerned primarily with:
•	past acts
•	legal entitlements
•	compensation after injury
________________________________________
III. Equity Defined (In Functional Terms)
Equity is a system of principles applied to:
•	restrain unconscionable conduct
•	compel performance of duties
•	prevent injustice before it occurs
•	supply remedies unavailable at law
Equity is concerned with:
•	conscience
•	fairness
•	proportionality
•	adequacy of legal remedies
Equity does not ask only:
“What are the parties’ rights?”
It asks:
“Would enforcing those rights be just under these circumstances?”

IV. The Core Jurisdictional Test: Adequacy of Legal Remedy
The single most important boundary rule is this:
Equity will not act if there is an adequate remedy at law.
This principle controls:
•	whether equity has jurisdiction
•	whether equitable relief may be granted
•	whether the court may exercise discretion
An “adequate” legal remedy must be:
•	plain
•	complete
•	practical
•	efficient
Money damages are not adequate where:
•	harm is irreparable
•	damages are speculative
•	property is unique
•	trust or fiduciary duties are involved

V. Law Acts In Rem; Equity Acts In Personam
Law (In Rem)
•	acts upon property or status
•	enforces judgments through execution
•	remedies attach to things
Equity (In Personam)
•	acts upon the defendant’s conscience
•	compels conduct or restraint
•	enforced through contempt powers
This distinction explains why:
•	equity can order conduct affecting foreign property
•	equity can bind parties beyond territorial limits

VI. Remedies Compared
Feature	        Law	        Equity
________________________________________
Primary Remedy	Damages	    Injunction, specific performance, trust
Timing	        After harm	Preventive or corrective
Nature	        Fixed	    Discretionary
Enforcement	    Execution	Contempt
Focus	        Rights	    Fairness

Importantly:
The remedy determines the jurisdiction, not the label used by the plaintiff.

VII. Defenses: Law vs. Equity
Legal Defenses
•	statute of limitations
•	failure of proof
•	lack of standing
•	procedural bars
Equitable Defenses
•	laches
•	unclean hands
•	estoppel
•	acquiescence
•	inequitable conduct
Equitable defenses:
•	may defeat relief even where legal rights exist
•	focus on the plaintiff’s conduct
•	invoke conscience, not entitlement
________________________________________
VIII. Fusion of Law and Equity (What It Did—and Did Not Do)
The procedural merger:
•	abolished separate courts
•	unified pleadings
•	simplified practice
The merger did not:
•	abolish equitable principles
•	eliminate jurisdictional distinctions
•	convert equitable remedies into legal rights
“The fusion of law and equity did not fuse the principles of law and equity.”
— Maitland
Courts still ask:
•	Is this a legal or equitable claim?
•	Is the remedy legal or equitable?
•	Do equitable defenses apply?
________________________________________
IX. Equity Restrains Law
Equity does not override law arbitrarily.
Instead, it restrains law where enforcement would be unjust.
Classic examples:
•	enforcing a contract procured by fraud
•	enforcing a legal title obtained in breach of trust
•	enforcing forfeitures or penalties
Equity does not destroy legal rights—it regulates their enforcement.
________________________________________
X. Practical Consequences for Pleading
Every competent equity pleading must:
1.	Identify why law is inadequate
2.	Invoke equitable jurisdiction explicitly
3.	Frame relief in equitable terms
4.	Anticipate equitable defenses
A pleading that merely asks for equitable relief without grounding it in jurisdictional doctrine is defective.

XI. Key Takeaways for the Student
1.	Law and equity remain distinct in substance
2.	Equity depends on inadequacy of legal remedies
3.	Remedies define jurisdiction
4.	Equity focuses on conscience and fairness
5.	Procedural merger did not abolish doctrine

XII. Preparation for What Comes Next
This distinction governs:
•	injunctions
•	trust enforcement
•	fiduciary litigation
•	equitable defenses
•	discretionary rulings
You cannot master equity without mastering this boundary.
