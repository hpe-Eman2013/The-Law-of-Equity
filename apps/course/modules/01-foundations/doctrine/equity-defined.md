Equity Defined: Jurisdiction, Nature, and Purpose
Purpose (Definition + jurisdiction)
	Formal definition of equity as a jurisdiction
	Historical + modern articulation
	Citations to Story, Pomeroy, Snell

Think of this as
“What equity is, before we argue with it.”
I.	What Equity Is (Authoritative Definition)
Equity is not a separate body of law in the sense of statutes or common-law rules.
Equity is a jurisdiction and system of principles exercised by courts to prevent injustice where the rigid application of law would produce an unconscionable result.
“Equity is that portion of remedial justice which is administered by courts of equity as distinguished from courts of law.” — Joseph Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence
Equity operates in personam, acting upon the conscience of the defendant, rather than merely declaring legal rights in rem.

II.	Why Equity Exists
Equity exists because law is necessarily general, while justice is necessarily particular.
The common law historically suffered from:
	rigid forms of action
	fixed remedies (primarily damages)
	inability to account for fraud, mistake, accident, or abuse of confidence
Equity developed to correct these failures.
“Equity arose from the inability of the common law courts to afford adequate relief in certain classes of cases.” — John Norton Pomeroy, “A Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence”
Equity does not exist to replace law, but to supplement and restrain it.

III.	Equity as a Jurisdiction (Not Merely a Remedy)
A critical error made by students—and often by litigants—is assuming equity is merely about remedies.
That is incorrect.
Equity is:
	a jurisdiction
	guided by maxims
	governed by discretion
	limited by conscience and fairness
A court does not grant equitable relief merely because:
	a legal right exists, or
	the plaintiff has suffered harm
Instead, the court must first determine whether the matter is properly within equity’s jurisdiction.

IV.	The Conscience of the Court
Equity historically acted through the Chancellor, who was described as the “keeper of the King’s conscience.”
While modern courts no longer speak in religious or moral terms, the concept survives as:
	good faith
	fairness
	absence of unconscionable conduct
	clean hands
“Equity acts upon the conscience, and will not permit one to avail himself of a legal advantage obtained through fraud, accident, or mistake.” — Snell, Principles of Equity

V.	Equity Acts In Personam
Unlike law, which traditionally acts in rem (upon property or status), equity acts in personam.
This means:
	equity compels a person to act or refrain from acting
	equity decrees are enforced through contempt, not execution alone

Examples:
	Injunctions
	specific performance
	accountings
	constructive trusts
This distinction explains why equity can:
	order conduct across jurisdictions
	bind parties even where property is elsewhere

VI.	Discretion Is Central to Equity
Equity is not mechanical.
Even where all elements are satisfied:
	relief may still be denied
	relief may be shaped or limited
	relief may be conditioned upon performance by the plaintiff

“Equitable relief is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion.”
— Pomeroy
This discretion is not arbitrary, but structured by:
	maxims of equity
	precedent
	proportionality
	fairness between the parties

VII.	Equity Is Preventive as Well as Remedial
Law typically compensates after harm occurs.
Equity frequently intervenes before harm becomes irreparable.
This is why equity grants:
	Injunctions
	restraining orders
	preventive relief

The guiding principle is irreparable harm—harm that cannot be adequately remedied by damages.

VIII.	Equity in the Modern Court
Although law and equity have merged procedurally in most jurisdictions, they remain distinct in substance.
Modern courts still:
	apply equitable principles
	deny relief for laches, unclean hands, or inequitable conduct
	distinguish legal claims from equitable ones

“The fusion of law and equity did not fuse the principles of law and equity.”
— Maitland

Equity remains alive, powerful, and essential, particularly in:
	trust law
	fiduciary litigation
	injunction practice
	unjust enrichment
	equitable defenses

IX.	Key Takeaways for the Student
1.	Equity is a jurisdiction, not just a remedy
2.	Equity exists to prevent injustice, not to reward technical rights
3.	Equity acts in personam and appeals to conscience
4.	Equitable relief is discretionary, not automatic
5.	Understanding equity requires understanding why relief should be granted, not just whether it can be

X.	Why This Matters for Drafting and Pleading
Every equitable pleading must:
	invoke equity’s jurisdiction
	justify the court’s intervention
	address conscience, fairness, and proportionality

A failure to understand what equity is will result in:
	defective pleadings
	denied relief
	adverse discretionary rulings

This course will train you to think, write, and argue as equity courts do.
