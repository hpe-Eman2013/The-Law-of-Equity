The Maxims of Equity
Judicial Principles Governing Equitable Jurisdiction and Relief
________________________________________
I. What the Maxims Are (and Are Not)
The maxims of equity are:
•	distilled judicial principles
•	guides to discretionary decision-making
•	constraints on equitable power
•	interpretive tools for courts and advocates
They are not rigid rules.
They are presumptions that operate unless displaced by stronger equities.
Courts rely on them to answer the question:
“Should equity act here—and if so, how?”

II. Equity Will Not Suffer a Wrong Without a Remedy
Meaning
Where legal remedies fail or are inadequate, equity may intervene.
Function
•	Justifies equitable jurisdiction
•	Expands remedies beyond damages
•	Prevents injustice caused by procedural or doctrinal gaps
Limits
•	Does not create rights
•	Does not override statutes
•	Operates only where law is insufficient
Modern Application
•	injunctions
•	constructive trusts
•	equitable liens
•	fiduciary enforcement

III. Equity Follows the Law
Meaning
Equity respects legal rights and statutes.
Function
•	Prevents arbitrary judicial power
•	Ensures harmony between law and equity
•	Preserves predictability
Critical Distinction
Equity follows the law unless:
•	enforcement would be unconscionable
•	fraud, mistake, or trust obligations intervene
Equity supplements law; it does not nullify it.

IV. He Who Seeks Equity Must Do Equity
Meaning
A party seeking equitable relief must be willing to act fairly.
Function
•	Conditions relief on reciprocal fairness
•	Prevents opportunism
•	Requires restoration or tender where appropriate
Applications
•	rescission (refers to the legal remedy that cancels a contract or agreement, effectively treating it as if it never existed)
•	reformation (an equitable remedy that allows a court to modify or correct a written contract, deed, will, or other legal document to reflect the true intentions of the parties involved, typically when there has been a mutual mistake, unilateral mistake with inequitable conduct, or fraudulent misrepresentation)
•	specific performance (an equitable remedy in contract law that requires a party to fulfill their specific contractual obligations as agreed, rather than paying monetary damages for breach)
•	injunctions with conditions (a court-ordered remedy that compels a party to perform a specific act or prohibits them from doing a particular action, serving as an equitable remedy when monetary damages are inadequate to address the harm)
A court may deny or condition relief if equity requires mutual adjustment.

V. He Who Comes Into Equity Must Come With Clean Hands
Meaning
Equitable relief is unavailable to those who engage in inequitable conduct related to the subject matter.
Key Features
•	Conduct-based
•	Discretionary
•	Context-specific
Limits
•	Misconduct must be related to the claim
•	Not a general moral inquiry
•	Not a substitute for legal defenses
Modern Use
•	bars injunctive relief
•	defeats trust claims
•	limits fiduciary enforcement

VI. Equity Aids the Vigilant, Not Those Who Slumber on Their Rights (Laches)
Meaning
Delay may bar equitable relief even if the claim is legally valid.
Elements
1.	unreasonable delay
2.	prejudice to the defendant
Distinction
•	Laches ≠ statute of limitations
•	Equity measures fairness, not calendar time
Application
•	injunctions
•	trust enforcement
•	equitable accounting
________________________________________
VII. Equity Acts In Personam
Meaning
Equity compels or restrains conduct rather than adjudicating title alone.
Consequences
•	jurisdiction over the person is key
•	foreign property may be affected indirectly
•	enforcement occurs through contempt
This maxim explains equity’s flexibility and reach.
________________________________________
VIII. Equity Regards as Done That Which Ought to Be Done
Meaning
Equity treats obligations as fulfilled where conscience requires.
Applications
•	equitable conversion
•	trusts arising from contracts
•	specific performance
Effect
•	alters timing of rights
•	re-characterizes interests
•	bridges formal gaps
________________________________________
IX. Equity Looks to the Intent Rather Than the Form
Meaning
Substance prevails over technical formalities.
Function
•	defeats sham transactions
•	enforces trust intent
•	prevents abuse of legal forms
Modern Use
•	constructive trusts
•	re-characterization of transactions
•	fiduciary analysis
________________________________________
X. Equity Will Not Enforce a Penalty or Forfeiture
Meaning
Equity restrains disproportionate punishment.
Scope
•	contractual penalties
•	forfeiture clauses
•	oppressive remedies
Exception
Where forfeiture reflects genuine compensation, equity may allow it.
________________________________________
XI. Equality Is Equity
Meaning
Equity favors proportional and fair distribution.
Applications
•	trust administration
•	receiverships
•	insolvency
•	partition
This maxim governs distribution, not entitlement.
________________________________________
XII. Where the Equities Are Equal, the Law Prevails
Meaning
When no superior equity exists, legal rights control.
Function
•	resolves tie-cases
•	reinforces legal certainty
•	restrains judicial discretion
Equity intervenes only when conscience demands it.
________________________________________
XIII. Maxims as a System, Not Isolated Rules
Courts rarely cite a single maxim alone.
They balance multiple maxims simultaneously.
Example:
•	clean hands vs. remedy for wrong
•	laches vs. continuing harm
•	intent vs. statutory command
Mastery requires integration, not recitation.

XIV. Practical Consequences for Advocacy
Every equitable pleading should:
•	align with favorable maxims
•	anticipate adverse maxims
•	frame facts to trigger equitable conscience
•	avoid conduct that triggers denial
A lawyer who understands the maxims controls:
•	discretion
•	framing
•	remedies
•	outcomes
________________________________________
XV. Student Mastery Standard
A student has not mastered equity until they can:
•	identify which maxims apply
•	explain conflicts between maxims
•	argue why one maxim should prevail
•	predict discretionary outcomes
