Module 1 – Exercise 1
Equity Foundations: Conscience, Jurisdiction, and Remedy
Exercise Type
Major Research & Judicial Writing Exercise
(Required for advancement)
________________________________________
Objective
This exercise is designed to test whether the student can:
•	Distinguish law and equity as distinct jurisdictions
•	Explain why equity exists, not merely what it does
•	Apply equitable principles in a modern court setting
•	Argue from primary authority, not opinion
•	Write in a manner suitable for a court of equity
This is not a summary exercise. This is an argumentative judicial analysis.
________________________________________
Scenario (Fact Pattern)
A state trial court hears a civil action involving the following facts:
•	A settlor establishes a trust for the benefit of his grandchildren.
•	The trustee, acting within the literal terms of the trust instrument, transfers trust assets to an LLC in which the trustee holds a personal interest.
•	No statute expressly prohibits the transaction.
•	The trust document does not explicitly forbid such a transfer.
•	The beneficiaries allege that the transaction was unconscionable, self-dealing, and violative of fiduciary duty.
•	The trustee argues that:
    o	The action was legally authorized
    o	No statute was violated
    o	The trust instrument was followed
    o	Therefore, no relief should be granted
The court must decide whether to grant equitable relief, despite the absence of a statutory or contractual violation.

Assignment
Part I — Research (Mandatory)
You must consult at least five (5) distinct sources, including:
•	At least two classical equity treatises (e.g., Pomeroy, Story, Snell, Adams, Seton)
•	At least one source addressing trust law as an equitable institution
•	At least one discussion of the law–equity distinction or fusion
•	At least one case or judicial opinion grounded in equitable reasoning
All sources must be cited using Bluebook format.
Failure to meet the source requirement results in automatic failure, regardless of writing quality.
________________________________________
Part II — Written Paper
Prepare a judicial-style memorandum or mini-opinion addressing the following question:
May a modern court sitting in equity grant relief against a trustee who has complied with the literal terms of the trust instrument and applicable statutes, where the trustee’s conduct is alleged to be unconscionable?
Your paper must address:
1.	The historical purpose of equity
    o	Why equity exists
    o	Why compliance with law alone may be insufficient
2.	The nature of equitable jurisdiction
    o	In personam authority
    o	The role of conscience
    o	Fiduciary accountability
3.	The relationship between law and equity
    o	What “equity follows the law” actually means
    o	Why procedural fusion does not eliminate equitable doctrines
4.	Application to the facts
    o	Whether equity may intervene
    o	What equitable remedies may be appropriate
    o	Why a court would or would not act
5.	Modern relevance
    o	How contemporary courts apply these principles today
    o	Why equity remains essential in trust litigation
________________________________________
Part III — Remedy Analysis (Required)
Conclude your paper by identifying at least two equitable remedies the court could impose, such as:
•	Constructive trust
•	Accounting
•	Injunction
•	Removal of trustee
•	Equitable surcharge
Explain why each remedy is equitable in nature and how it operates upon the person, not merely the property.
