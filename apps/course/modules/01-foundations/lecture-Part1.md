MODULE 01 – FOUNDATIONS
Part 1: The Origins of Equity – Roman Æquitas and the Birth of English Equity

(Based on Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (1881), §§ 1–10)

A. Learning Objectives

By the end of this Part, the student should be able to:

1. Explain why a historical study of Equity is essential to understanding modern Equity jurisprudence.

2. Describe the Roman system of legis actiones and formulæ, and why it was considered rigid and formalistic.

3. Distinguish between the praetor’s ordinary and extraordinary jurisdiction in Roman law.

4. Define jus civile, jus gentium, and lex naturæ, and explain how they relate to æquitas.

5. Describe how Roman æquitas gradually permeated the entire legal system rather than forming a separate court.

6. Identify the key contrast Pomeroy draws between Roman magistrates and early English common law judges.

7. Describe in broad strokes the consuetudinary character of early English law and why this sets the stage for a distinct court of equity.

B. Section I – Why Study the Origins of Equity? (Pomeroy § 1)

1. Equity as a Separate System with Its Own History

-> Pomeroy opens by stating that he will not attempt an exhaustive history of Equity; that task was done by Spence in his work on the jurisdiction of Chancery.

-> Instead, he aims to give a concise historical sketch to explain:

    -> Where equitable jurisdiction came from,

    -> What sources supplied its principles,

    -> Why a separate court of Chancery emerged with distinct procedure.

2. Why This History Is “Absolutely Essential”

-> Without understanding how Equity arose, the student cannot accurately grasp:

    -> The true nature of Equity,

    -> The functions it serves within the broader legal system,

    -> Why its doctrines and remedies differ from those at law.

-> The historical review shows how a small set of ideas developed into a vast body of doctrines forming a major branch of the municipal law.

3. Pedagogical Framing for the Course

-> This Part of the module uses Pomeroy’s approach:

    -> First, Roman æquitas,

    -> Then, English Chancery,

    -> Finally, the American adaptations.

-> Students are to view Equity not as a random list of special remedies, but as the outcome of a long evolution driven by moral and practical needs.

C. Section II – Roman Æquitas and the Transformation of Rigid Law (Pomeroy §§ 2–9)
1. Roman Æquitas as the Prototype (Pomeroy § 2)

-> Pomeroy notes that the development of Equity in English law was anticipated by a similar development in Roman law.

-> The early English chancellors and their equitable jurisdiction were consciously inspired by Roman practice:

    -> They borrowed not only ideas but also the judicial role of Roman magistrates.

-> Therefore, understanding Roman æquitas provides crucial background for English Equity.

Key idea:

Roman æquitas is not a historical curiosity; it is the intellectual ancestor of English and American Equity.

2. From Legis Actiones to Formulae – Formalism and Its Limits (Pomeroy §§ 3–4)

-> In the earliest Roman period and through the era of the Twelve Tables:

    -> Civil rights were enforced through five rigid “actions of the law”.

    -> These proceedings were extremely technical:

        -> Exact words and movements were required.

        -> Any minor mistake could destroy the plaintiff’s case.

-> A later jurist (Gaius) remarks that these ancient actions fell into disuse because the jurists made them so subtle that the slightest error was fatal.

-> Over time, these formal actions were replaced (except for one limited survival) by a more flexible system of written formulæ:

    -> The formula contained:

        -> A factual statement of the claim,

        -> The defendant’s defense,

        -> The appointment of a judex (lay decision-maker),

        -> The direction to the judex on when to condemn or acquit.

    -> The formula was brief, structured, and controlled by the magistrate.

-> Pomeroy emphasizes the analogy between:

    -> The old Roman actions and the early English real actions,

    -> The formula system and later pleading at law, showing how both systems evolved away from extreme technicality.

Teaching emphasis:

-> Formalistic systems produce injustice when form controls over substance.

-> Equity in both Roman and English contexts emerges as a correction to such rigidity.

3. The Role of the Praetor – Ordinary vs Extraordinary Jurisdiction (Pomeroy §§ 4–7)

-> The praetors (Urban and Peregrine) were the principal judicial magistrates.

    -> In their ordinary jurisdiction, they used the formula system:

        -> Parties appeared before the magistrate;

        -> The magistrate settled the formula;

        -> A judex then tried the case and rendered judgment.

    -> The judex is likened to a jury:

        -> Decides facts under a legal rule already framed for him.

-> Later, an extraordinary jurisdiction arose:

    -> The magistrate himself decided both law and fact;

    -> Proceedings were not constrained by the technical requirements of any particular action;

    -> This allowed:

        -> Remedies where none previously existed,

        -> Flexible procedures,

        -> Closer attention to substantive justice rather than mere form.

-> Pomeroy draws a strong analogy:

    -> Ordinary praetorian procedure ≈ common law forms of action;

    -> Extraordinary jurisdiction ≈ Chancery procedure in Equity.

Teaching emphasis:

-> Extraordinary jurisdiction is the procedural ancestor of Equity:

    -> Fact-centered,

    -> Less technical,

    -> Remedy-creating.

4. The Legislative Function of the Praetor and the Edict (Pomeroy §§ 5–7)

-> Praetors functioned both as judges and, in practice, as law-makers:

    -> Through their annual edicts, they announced:

        -> Cases where new remedies would be allowed,

        -> Situations where new defenses would be recognized against harsh applications of the old law.

-> Over time, their edicts formed a continuous body of evolving law:

    -> Each praetor modified, added to, or adopted the edict of his predecessor.

-> Pomeroy compares this to:

    -> The way English judges create law through decisions;

    -> The key difference is form, not substance.

-> Importantly:

    -> The praetors used new actions:

        1. Extending existing actions to new but similar situations,

        2. Creating new actions analogous to old ones,

        3. Eventually inventing entirely new actions with no connection to the old forms.

    -> It is in this third category that we see the clearest emergence of equitable doctrines, correcting arbitrary rules of the older jus civile.

Teaching emphasis:

-> The praetor’s creative authority is analogous to Equity’s development:

    -> New actions, new defenses, and new remedies embody equitable notions that soften or override rigid rules.

5. Jus Civile, Jus Gentium, Lex Naturæ, and the Birth of Æquitas (Pomeroy §§ 8–9)

-> Pomeroy explains that praetors and jurisconsults drew from two main sources:

    1. Jus gentium – rules of law common to many nations (observed in the laws of various peoples);

    2. Lex naturæ – the Stoic “law of nature,” a moral order assumed to govern the world.

-> As these two bodies of thought converged:

    -> Rules common across nations were treated as expressions of natural law.

    -> From this emerged æquitas:

        -> So named because it was thought to be impartial (from æquum),

        -> Aimed to protect the interests of all affected parties, not just those favored by the strict civil law.

-> When rigid application of the old jus civile would cause moral wrong or injustice:

    -> The praetor would supply a new action or defense based on natural law and æquitas.

    -> Over time, a body of moral principles penetrated the entire legal order.

-> Crucially:

    -> Roman æquitas did not create a separate court.

    -> It transformed the existing system from within:

        -> Replacing what was arbitrary and unjust,

        -> Aligning the law with prevailing moral standards.

Teaching emphasis:

-> Roman æquitas = law corrected by conscience and universal morality, fully integrated into the system, not housed in a separate tribunal.

-> This contrasts sharply with the English experience, where resistance by common law judges ultimately forced the creation of a separate chancery court.

D. Section III – Bridge to English Equity (Pomeroy § 10 – partial)

The information in § 10 is enough to begin the bridge:

1. Primitive English Law as Customary (Consuetudinary)

-> Early Anglo-Saxon and Norman law was largely custom-based:

    -> Written codes mostly summarized existing customs,

    -> Some precepts were drawn from Scripture and fragments of Roman law.

-> Local folk courts and the high council (Witan) were not staffed by professional judges and relied heavily on settled custom.

2. Why This Matters for Equity

-> Custom-based systems tend to:

    -> Be stable but resistant to change,

    -> Rely on fixed practices,

    -> Lack built-in mechanisms for rapid doctrinal development.

-> As society evolves, gaps and hardships appear which the rigid customs cannot address.

-> In England, unlike Rome, the primary judges of the common law were reluctant to innovate, which sets the stage for:

    -> A separate court (Chancery),

    -> A separate jurisdiction (Equity),

    -> A dual system (law and equity side by side).

Teaching emphasis:

-> Roman magistrates absorbed equity within their ordinary jurisdiction;

-> English common law judges refused, requiring a separate system.

-> This contrast is one of the central themes of the Foundations module.

E. Wrap-Up for Part 1 – Key Takeaways

At the end of this Part, highlight:

1. Both Roman and English systems began with rigid, formal, action-based procedures.

2. Roman praetors, using edicts and extraordinary jurisdiction, integrated equity into the system.

3. The concept of æquitas arose from universal principles (jus gentium + lex naturæ) and aimed at impartial justice.

4. In Rome, equity permeated the law; in England, resistance by common law courts led to a separate court of equity.

5. Early English law’s reliance on custom explains why a separate equitable jurisdiction became necessary.
